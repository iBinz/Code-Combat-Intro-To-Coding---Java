# CodeCombat | Intro To Coding | JavaScript Version

I have created this repository as somewhat of a cheat sheet. All of these scripts will have the least amount of lines of code necessary to complete the level! If my repository helped you, sharing this repository could help other people in need of the code. If you have any other questions leave a comment / issue!

Thanks,
iBinz
